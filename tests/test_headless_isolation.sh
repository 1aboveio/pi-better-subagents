# Scenario 6: a subagent survives a parallel `bash` + `read` batch (issue #17).
#
# This is the regression that made subagents unusable. A child that loads every
# installed package can inherit one that replaces builtin `bash` with a
# `detached` + `proc.unref()` spawn. In print mode the in-process `read`
# finishes, the unref'd `bash` does not hold the event loop, Node drains, and the
# child EXITS 0 MID-TURN — no `tool_execution_end` for bash, no `agent_end`.
# Exit 0 is indistinguishable from a clean finish, so it was reported as ✓
# completed. Measured: 30 recorded runs, 17 died this way, all reported success.
#
# A tool allowlist cannot fix it — the package overrode builtin `bash` at startup,
# so the `bash` in the allowlist IS the broken one. What fixes it is not LOADING
# the package: `--no-extensions -e <only what the tools need>`, which run_child
# now builds via the product resolver.
#
# The test proves both halves of the contract in one run:
#   1. every tool_execution_start has a tool_execution_end (nothing drained)
#   2. web_fetch still works, so isolation did not cost us the tools we asked for
