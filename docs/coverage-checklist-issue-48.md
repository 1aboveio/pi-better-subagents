## Coverage Checklist

_Every row = a decision (PASS / FAIL / N/A) backed by a checkable evidence locator (`file:line`, a rerunnable `command`, or #issue). Gate rows are auto-filled by `coverage-checklist.mjs generate`; lead/judgment rows are completed by the reviewer. A PASS/FAIL row with no locator, or a gate row left TODO, fails `coverage-checklist.mjs validate`._

Issue: #48 (harden subagent navigator rendering, reload behavior, and docs). Scope class: `surface-bearing` (`scope-class.mjs classify --stdin` over `2fe2af5...HEAD` → unmatched runtime paths include `index.ts`, `navigator.mjs`, `navigator.ts`). Stacked unit: base is `issue-47-close-subagent-navigator` (`2fe2af5`), not `main`.

### Breadth

| Check | Method | Decision | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Surface inventory + route manifest regenerated; no drift | gate-lint | PASS | `docs/tests/_generated/surface-inventory.json` regenerated with `navigator.hardening` (mutation); no browser route manifest exists in this pi extension (precedent: `docs/coverage-checklist-issue-47.md`) |
| Every changed surface is owned and proven at its floor (no Missing/Orphan) | gate-lint | PASS | command: `node coverage-ledger.mjs validate` → "18 surfaces · 18 aligned · 0/18 tested surfaces over-mocked" — zero Missing/Orphan/Unrealized for the 1 #48 surface (owned by `docs/tests/issue-48-hardening-subagent-navigator.coverage.yml`, proven by `tests/navigator_hardening.test.mjs`); exit 1 is solely `Unverified` attestation rows (17 pre-existing across #13/#39/#44/#45/#46/#47 + 1 #48 row a producer may not self-attest — awaiting reviewer promotion per ensure-coverage) |
| No un-specced capability missed — the surfaces no AC mentions | judgment | PASS | issue #48 ACs cover narrow list/detail truncation, selection stability across status refresh, selection clamp on dismiss/disappear, footer restore after close/dismiss/stop/reload/teardown, editor wrapper non-stacking, overlay timer + confirm clear on all close/teardown paths, passive widget unchanged, non-TUI tool/API-only, user-facing docs, full unit suite, integration smoke validity; slice map in `docs/tests/issue-48-plan.md` — no other surfaces changed (`git diff 2fe2af5...HEAD --name-only`: index.ts, navigator.mjs, navigator.ts, tests + docs + README) |
| Reachability/mutation classification is correct for changed surfaces | judgment | PASS | inventory class: `navigator.hardening`=mutation (selection keep-by-id on row refresh via `applyNavigatorRows`, session_start dispose + confirm-clear on reload); local extension seam, no HTTP/API routes |

### Depth

| Check | Method | Decision | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| No test skipped/focused/xfail added | gate-lint | PASS | `lint-tests.mjs --rules no-skip --diff 2fe2af5` → 0 findings |
| No fixed sleep added (waitForTimeout / numeric cy.wait / time.sleep) | gate-lint | PASS | `lint-tests.mjs --rules no-fixed-timeout --diff 2fe2af5` → 0 findings (close arm / detail tick use injected fake clock/setTimeout/setInterval) |
| No empty/placeholder test body added (passes vacuously, asserts nothing) | gate-lint | PASS | `lint-tests.mjs --rules no-empty-test --diff 2fe2af5` → 0 findings |
| Each added test actually asserts a behavior (not a no-op or helper-only render-health mislabeled as a journey) | lead | PASS | `tests/navigator_hardening.test.mjs` — unit pins on observable outcomes (post style-strip width, selectById/applyNavigatorRows keep-by-id + clamp, overlay dismiss clamp, footer count/confirm clear, escape/dispose/expiry timer+hint clear, editor reload dedupe, session_shutdown teardown, TUI guard, widget isolation, README controls); reload lifecycle proven by `tests/navigator_reload_extension_path.test.mjs` (registered factory → session_start → open → detail+arm → second session_start → timers/confirm clear, no editor stack, footer republish); commands: `node --test tests/navigator_hardening.test.mjs tests/navigator_reload_extension_path.test.mjs`; full suite `node --test tests/*.test.mjs` |
| Declared @level meets each surface floor (no Wrong Level) | gate-lint | PASS | `@level unit` tags in `tests/navigator_hardening.test.mjs` match `requiredLevels: [unit]` in `docs/tests/issue-48-hardening-subagent-navigator.coverage.yml`; coverage-ledger → 18 aligned, 0 Wrong-Level (residual exit-1 rows are `Unverified` attestation only — see breadth row) |
| First-party interception in a behaviour/journey test is justified, not counted as real coverage | lead | N/A | no browser / Playwright tests in diff (`git diff 2fe2af5...HEAD --name-only`) |
| No mock of a first-party internal seam module (real internals, faked externals) — zero-tolerance: PR-lane (new) AND whole-tree (inherited); no `@mock-ok` waiver; resolve by making it real, faking the external, or DELETING the test (over-mock is worse than no test); a false positive is fixed by correcting topology in coverage.config.json | gate-lint | PASS | `lint-tests.mjs --rules mock-internal-seam --diff 2fe2af5` → 0 findings (PR lane); whole-tree → 0 findings; `scan-diff.mjs` findings channel `[]` — no `vi.mock`/`jest.mock` anywhere; tests use REAL `navigator.mjs` seams and REAL registry visibility/dismiss; only EXTERNAL boundaries are faked (pi UI/custom/theme, injected clock/setTimeout/setInterval, matchKey/truncate) — per #43's testing decisions |
| Mock use respects the boundary; money/auth/idempotency never mock-only | judgment | N/A | no mocks of internal seams; not a money/auth surface |
| Assertions are behavior-first; none pass on a 404 / empty / error page | judgment | PASS | assertions target externally visible behavior: line widths after style strip, selected row id after refresh/dismiss, footer status key/value pairs, timer pending counts, setEditorComponent call count, README control strings, TUI guard truth table — never private helper internals beyond stable seams; command: `node --test tests/navigator_hardening.test.mjs` |
| Every new branch / error path has a driving test | lead | PASS | `scan-diff.mjs` new-branch leads adjudicated: `applyNavigatorRows` keep-by-id / empty / disappear → selection stability suite; overlay `refreshRows` using applyNavigatorRows → dismiss clamp + leave-detail reorder tests; `selectById` missing id clamp → selectById test; session_start dispose + CLOSE_CONFIRM clear under isNavigatorUiAvailable → `tests/navigator_reload_extension_path.test.mjs` behavior-driven registered path (not source scan); installNavigatorEditor refresh path → editor reload dedupe test; test-file helper branches (drive harness, fakeClock, timer spies) are test infrastructure, not product branches |
| Diffs that modify existing behavior are pinned by a characterization test (prior behavior) before the change — or an intended change is declared with its AC | lead | PASS | intended hardening declared against #48 ACs: (1) `refreshRows` now keeps selection by id via `applyNavigatorRows` (was bare `state.rows = next`); (2) `session_start` disposes tracked overlay + clears close-confirm before reinstall/republish. Prior #45–#47 suites still pass (selection after leave-detail, two-press close, editor install). Widget path UNCHANGED — non-regression pinned by existing `tests/widget_flicker.test.mjs` + hardening widget isolation test. Non-TUI isolation unchanged (`isNavigatorUiAvailable`) |
| Runtime smoke: each changed non-browser surface (service/API/CLI/job) was actually run via the repo run command and its happy path responded (boots, no 500/crash on first call) — green tests alone do not prove the thing runs; browser surfaces use the presentation sweep instead | gate-lint | PASS | `docs/tests/issue-48-runtime-smoke.json` → 1 surface(s), 0 fail; rerun: `node docs/tests/issue-48-runtime-smoke.mjs` (applyNavigatorRows keep-by-id + clamp; list/detail narrow post style-strip; overlay dismiss clamp against real registry; editor reload dedupe; dispose clears detail+arm timers+confirm; footer count/confirm clear; registered session_start reload path via `tests/navigator_reload_extension_path.test.mjs`; TUI guard; `node --experimental-strip-types --check index.ts navigator.ts`; README controls) |

### Presentation

| Check | Method | Decision | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| render-health is in the floor for every changed browser route | gate-lint | N/A | no browser routes in this pi extension (`git diff 2fe2af5...HEAD --name-only` — no route/page files) |
| Presentation sweep ran (runtime gate): no pageerror/overflow/overlap/shift; nothing blocked | gate-lint | N/A | no browser routes |
| Sweep specs do not intercept first-party traffic | lead | N/A | no browser routes |
| Perceivability edge cases the instruments cannot score are checked | judgment | N/A | no browser routes |

### Enforcement

| Check | Method | Decision | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| CI wires all required gates and keeps them blocking | gate-lint | PASS | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the type-strip check + `node --test tests/*.test.mjs` on PRs (the gates applicable to this extension repo — no browser surfaces, so no sweep/e2e gates exist to wire; precedent: `docs/coverage-checklist-issue-47.md` enforcement row) |
