# pi-better-subagents

A better subagent extension for [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-coding-agent).

Not a clone of Claude Code's subagents — a rethink of what a subagent system
should be: **autonomous, non-blocking, and safe by default.** You delegate work
and keep going; each subagent runs on its own in an isolated process, confined to
what it needs, and reports back when it's done. No blocking waits, no
back-channel for it to stall on, no unbounded blast radius.

```
launch is the result · completion triggers fetch · the foreground never blocks
```

## Principles

- **The foreground never blocks.** Launching a subagent *is* the deliverable —
  `subagent_spawn` starts a detached `pi -p` child and returns immediately,
  leaving the session free for the human. When the child finishes, it sends a
  lightweight trigger; the foreground calls `subagent_result` and presents the
  result (as a `followUp`, never cutting into work in progress). The foreground
  is nudged once, at completion — never on a wait/poll loop.
- **Subagents are autonomous; communication is one-way (parent → child).** The
  parent front-loads everything the child needs into the spawn; the child runs to
  completion and **returns a result**. There is no mid-task child→parent blocking
  call for a subagent to waste wall-clock on — a child missing a piece of info
  resolves it from what it was given, or records it unavailable and returns.
- **Safe by default.** Every subagent is OS-sandboxed — writes confined to its
  working directory, reads and network open — and scoped to an explicit tool
  allowlist. It can't corrupt the parent, escape its directory, or recurse into
  more subagents without opt-in.
- **Observable.** A live status widget and on-demand queries show each run's
  elapsed time and token/cost spend.

## Tools

| Tool | Blocks? | What it does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `subagent_spawn` | never | Launch a task in a background subagent; returns a run id at once. Params: `prompt`, `name`, `model`, `tools` (allowlist), `exclude_tools`, `sandbox`, `sandbox_dir`, `callback`, `clean`, `cwd`, `git_clone_workspace`, `approve`, `allow_nested`. |
| `subagent_spawn_batch` | never | Launch several independent subagents at once. Each job becomes a normal run. Params: `batchName`, `shared` (options applied to every job), `jobs[]` (each needs `prompt`; same optional params as `subagent_spawn`), `onCapacity` (`reject` or `launch-available`). |
| `subagent_list` | never | List running/finished runs with status, model, elapsed, spend, and batch info. Params: `all`, `limit` (default 20, max 100; larger values are clamped), `status` (`running`, `completed`, `failed`, `killed`, `exited`). |
| `subagent_output` | never | Tail a run's live output as it stands right now. |
| `subagent_result` | never | Read a finished run's final output (says "still running" otherwise). |
| `subagent_stop` | never | SIGTERM a running run's process group. |

## Non-blocking, by construction

- **Process isolation.** Each run is a `detached` + `unref`'d `pi -p` process.
  Its context can't clog the parent, its crash can't corrupt parent state, and
  its output is durable in a log file.
- **Completion triggers a turn that fetches the result.** When the child exits,
  a lightweight trigger is sent with `pi.sendMessage(..., { deliverAs: "followUp", triggerTurn: true })` —
  it waits until the foreground agent has no pending tool calls (never cutting
  into work mid-stream), then the model calls `subagent_result` and presents the
  result. The actual result is never embedded in the trigger to avoid double-display.
  The run itself never blocks the foreground; the single nudge happens only at
  the end. Prefer `callback:false` to finish quietly and read the result on demand
  via `subagent_result`.
- **The prompt guidelines forbid polling.** The foreground agent is told, in the
  tool guidelines, that spawning is done and it must not loop on `output`/`result`
  or sleep to wait.

## Autonomy & safety

Every subagent is confined by default, and the confinement is **self-contained** —
it does not depend on any other extension being installed.

- **OS sandbox (default on, macOS and Linux).** The child runs under
  `sandbox-exec` on macOS or [bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap)
  (`bwrap`) on Linux with a simple rule: **reads and network are open; writes are
  confined to the working directory and host `/tmp`.** Kernel-enforced — unlike a
  cooperative guardrail that matches tool inputs, this denies the write syscall
  itself, so a crafted `bash` command can't escape it. `sandbox:false` lifts it;
  `sandbox_dir` moves the writable root (and becomes the child's cwd). `/dev`
  remains usable. macOS also permits pi state writes under `~/.pi`; Linux exposes
  that directory read-only, so Linux children must put writable pi state in their
  work directory or `/tmp`. Everything else (your home, the repo, `/etc`, …) is
  read-only to the subagent.
- **Tool allowlist.** The child is scoped to an explicit set of tools, which also
  decides what extension code loads (see below).
- **No runaway recursion.** A subagent cannot spawn its own subagents unless
  `allow_nested:true` — and not by denying the tools after the fact: without that
  flag this package isn't loaded in the child, so the tools don't exist.

### Git-mutating subagents and linked worktrees

A sandboxed subagent that will mutate Git should set **`git_clone_workspace:true`**
on `subagent_spawn`. The parent prepares a fresh, self-contained Git clone whose
`.git/` directory lives **inside the sandbox writable root**, then runs the child
in that clone.

Why this matters: a linked Git worktree (created with `git worktree add`) has a
`.git` file that points back to administrative state under the main repository,
typically outside the sandbox directory. A sandbox that only allows writes under
the worktree directory therefore cannot support normal Git producer operations
such as fetch, rebase, commit, and push — the child stalls or fails when Git
tries to write metadata it cannot reach. `git_clone_workspace:true` avoids this
by cloning the repository with a real `.git/` directory inside the writable root.

The clone uses:

```
git clone --reference-if-able <local-reference-repo> --dissociate \
          <remote-url> <sandbox-workspace>
```

`--reference-if-able` borrows local objects from the parent repository during
setup; `--dissociate` removes the alternates link afterwards, so the clone is
self-contained and safe to delete. The clone source prefers the source
workspace's upstream remote URL (`origin` when set) so the disposable
workspace's `origin` points at the real remote rather than the parent working
tree — pushes therefore target upstream, not the sandboxed parent. The local
repository is used only as a reference (and as a content fallback when no
remote is configured). Source remotes are re-synced after clone. The
checked-out branch/commit matches the source workspace at spawn time.
Repo-local Git identity settings from the source (`user.name`, `user.email`,
and `user.signingkey` when set) are copied into the clone so ordinary commits
work without reconfiguring identity inside the disposable workspace.

If the source workspace is a linked worktree, the clone is prepared from the
main repository's object database and the requested branch/commit; the child is
never launched into the structurally broken linked-worktree sandbox. If clone
preparation fails, the spawn fails fast with a message explaining that the
linked-worktree Git metadata is outside the sandbox and recommending
`git_clone_workspace:true`.

Note that because children load only the extensions backing their tools, a
guardrails extension (e.g. `@aliou/pi-guardrails`) does **not** apply inside a
subagent unless you map a tool to it. The OS write sandbox above is what confines
the child, and it doesn't depend on any extension.

## Tool scoping (allowlist)

Precedence, highest first: the per-call `tools` param → `config.json`
`defaultTools` → a built-in default (`read, bash, edit, write, web_search,
web_fetch`; just `read, bash` in a `clean` child). `exclude_tools` subtracts on
top.

`config.json` (next to the extension) also sets:

- `defaultModel` — model for spawns that don't specify one (`null` = inherit the
  foreground model).
- `maxConcurrent` — how many subagents may run at once (**default 4**). A spawn
  past the cap is rejected until a running one finishes.

## The allowlist also decides what LOADS

The `tools` allowlist does double duty: it is both what the child may call **and**
which extension *code* is loaded into it. A child launches as

```
pi -p --mode json --no-extensions -e <package backing a requested tool> ...
```

so a package that backs no requested tool never loads. With the default
allowlist (`read, bash, edit, write, web_search, web_fetch`) exactly one package
loads — the web-tools one — and `web_fetch` works normally.

Two maps in `config.json` drive it:

- `toolExtensions` — tool name → package(s) providing it. Built-ins (`read`,
  `bash`, `edit`, `write`) need no entry.
- `providerExtensions` — provider → auth package. Model auth is not tool-shaped:
  `xai/grok-4.5` needs `pi-xai-oauth` loaded whatever tools it was granted.

Ask for a tool with no mapping and the spawn still succeeds, but says so at
launch — the tool simply will not exist in the child.

`clean:true` is the narrowest case of the same mechanism: no extensions at all.
`allow_nested:true` is the one thing that loads *this* package into the child;
without it, nested spawning is impossible because the code isn't there.

`inheritExtensions: true` in `config.json` restores the old load-everything
behavior. It is **operator-only** — no spawn parameter can reach it, so the child
model cannot widen its own runtime. It also re-exposes the failure below.

### Why: a subagent that loads everything can die mid-turn reporting success

Loading every installed package means inheriting their startup side effects. A
package that replaces builtin `bash` with a `detached` + `unref()` spawn breaks
`pi -p`: on a parallel `bash` + `read` batch the in-process `read` finishes, the
unref'd `bash` doesn't hold the event loop, Node drains, and the child **exits 0
mid-turn** — no `tool_execution_end`, no `agent_end`. Historically, exit 0 was
indistinguishable from a clean finish, so all 17 observed mid-turn exits were
reported as ✓ completed. Finalization now requires terminal agent evidence and
no unmatched tool starts. Lifecycle validation classifies runs as `complete`,
`incomplete_no_terminal_event`, `incomplete_open_tools`, `failed_exit`, or
`killed`; incoherent exit-0 streams are recorded as failed with named lifecycle
diagnostics on `subagent_result` and attention wording on completion callbacks.

A tool allowlist alone cannot fix this. `--tools` restricts what the model may
*call*; the package already overrode builtin `bash` at startup, so the `bash` in
your allowlist **is** the broken one. Measured with the default 6 tools:

| runtime | tool starts / ends | terminal event |
|---|---|---|
| all extensions loaded | 2 / 1 | none — exits 0 mid-turn |
| `--no-extensions -e <web-tools>` | 3 / 3 | `agent_settled`, `web_fetch` OK |

A package *denylist* isn't expressible either: pi has only `-e <path>` (add one)
and `--no-extensions` (all off) — there is no "load all except X" flag. Naming
what you want is the only mechanism that excludes anything, and it excludes
future offenders too, with no name to keep updated.

### Known incompatibility: `pi-patty-bg-tasks`

**`pi-patty-bg-tasks` (tested at 1.1.6) is incompatible with subagents and must
not be loaded into a child.** It is the package that produced the failure above:
it replaces builtin `bash` and spawns `detached` + `proc.unref()`
(`src/spawn.ts`), which in print mode drains the event loop mid-turn. Bisected
against all 18 installed packages — alone it reproduces; every other package
alone is fine.

The default configuration already excludes it, structurally, because it backs no
requested tool. You only re-expose it by setting `inheritExtensions: true`, or by
mapping a tool to it in `toolExtensions`. Don't.

A proper fix belongs upstream — preserve builtin `bash` semantics when overriding
it, keep foreground subprocesses referenced until the tool promise settles, and
put genuinely detached work behind a separate background-task tool.

## Status & cost tracking

Driven by the child's `--mode json` usage events:

- **Live widget** above the editor while any subagent runs — a spinner per run
  with elapsed time, the current tool, and running token/cost spend, ticking once
  a second. It clears itself when the last run finishes. (TUI/RPC only; silent in
  `-p`/print mode.)
- **On demand** — `subagent_list`, `subagent_output`, and `subagent_result` all
  carry `elapsed · N tok (↑in ↓out) · $cost · tools`. The completion notice and
  toast include the final elapsed + spend too.

Spend is summed from each finalized assistant turn's `usage` (so multi-turn
tool-using runs total correctly), and cost comes straight from the model's
reported per-request cost.

## Subagent navigator (TUI)

In an interactive TUI session, a focused **subagent navigator** lets you inspect
and organize runs without asking the model to call a tool. It is separate from
the passive live widget (which stays a compact status signal and never takes
keyboard focus). Print/RPC modes do not install the navigator; tool access is
unchanged in every mode.

### Open

- With the editor **empty** and at least one visible current-parent run, press
  `←` to open the navigator overlay.
- If the editor contains text, `←` keeps normal cursor-left behavior.
- While visible runs exist, the default footer shows `← subagents · N`. The
  hint clears when every visible run is dismissed (or none remain).

### List view

- Newest visible runs first (running and terminal). Dismissed runs are hidden
  from this list and from the footer count only.
- Each row: name or id · status · model · elapsed · spend.
- `↑` / `↓` move selection. Selection stays on the same run across status
  refreshes when that run is still visible; if it disappears, selection clamps
  to a remaining row.
- `enter` opens the live detail view for the selected run.
- `esc` closes the navigator.

### Detail view

- Shows status, model, elapsed, current/used tools, spend, and parsed output.
  The view refreshes about once per second while open.
- `←` returns to the list (selection restored on the viewed run when still
  visible).
- `esc` closes the entire navigator.

### Two-press `x` close

- First `x` on the selected (list) or viewed (detail) run arms close for three
  seconds and shows a footer hint: `x again to stop <name>` while running, or
  `x again to dismiss <name>` when terminal.
- Second `x` within the window, on the **same** run, acts:
  - **Running** — stop the process group (shared `subagent_stop` semantics),
    mark killed, then dismiss from the navigator.
  - **Terminal** — dismiss only; terminal status is not rewritten.
- Changing selection, leaving the view, closing the overlay, arming timeout,
  reload, and session teardown all disarm close and clear the confirm hint.

### Dismissal is navigator-only

Dismissed runs leave the navigator list and footer count. Logs, prompt, session
data, metadata, and id-based tool access stay intact. `subagent_list`,
`subagent_output`, `subagent_result`, and `subagent_stop` still resolve dismissed
run ids. Dismissal survives `/reload` as dismissed in the navigator.

### Reload and teardown

`/reload` and session restart reinstall the empty-editor wrapper without stacking
duplicate handlers, republish the footer count, and clear any leftover overlay
timers or close-confirm state. Session shutdown disposes open navigator timers
and clears navigator footer statuses (TUI only).

## Design notes

- Runtime lives outside any repo, under `$TMPDIR/pi-better-subagents/`
  (`runs/<id>/` holds `output.log`, `prompt.md`, `meta.json`; `sessions/` holds
  child session state). The `meta.json` sidecar is authoritative, so `list` /
  `output` / `result` survive turns, `/reload`, and pi restarts.
- The child runs `--mode json`; `subagent_result` / `subagent_output` **parse**
  the event stream and return just the final answer (plus which tools ran).
  Non-JSON banner/warning lines fail to parse and are dropped, so the result is
  clean. The prompt is passed as a **positional argument**, never `@file` — some
  models refuse an @-attached file as untrusted content.
- The child gets **only** the explicit prompt — no silent parent-context bleed.
- `--approve` is **off by default** (headless runs can't prompt for trust).


## Parent-process scoping

The live widget, default `subagent_list`, concurrency cap, and `session_start` ticker only include runs this pi process spawned (`spawnPid === process.pid`). The on-disk registry stays machine-global for durability. `subagent_list` shows newest runs first and is capped at 20 rows by default; pass `limit:N` to request fewer or more rows, up to the documented maximum of 100 (larger values are clamped with a clear note). Pass `all:true` for a global view; it still respects the default or explicit limit. Pass `status:[...]` to filter by effective status: `running`, `completed`, `failed`, `killed`, or transient `exited`. Id-based `subagent_result` / `subagent_output` / `subagent_stop` still resolve any run id (cross-session recovery).

## Install

Linux sandboxing requires the system `bubblewrap` package. Install it before
launching sandboxed children:

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install bubblewrap
# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install bubblewrap
# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S bubblewrap
```

When `bwrap` is absent, explicit sandbox requests fail with an installation hint;
default-on sandboxing preserves the documented direct-execution fallback. Once
`bwrap` is selected, a launch failure fails closed rather than retrying the child
without confinement.

Symlink the project into pi's auto-discovered extensions dir:

```bash
ln -sfn "$PWD" ~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-better-subagents
```

Then `/reload` (or restart pi). It appears as `pi-better-subagents`.

> Do **not** add it to `settings.json`'s `extensions` array — a live pi session
> rewrites that file on its own saves and drops hand-added entries. Auto-discovery
> via the symlink is stable. Quick throwaway test without installing:
> `pi -e ./index.ts`.

## Tests

Unit tests (`node --test tests/*.test.mjs`) cover the pure logic — widget
rendering, completion delivery, and extension resolution.

Real integration smoke tests live in [`tests/`](tests/) — a subagent using
`web_fetch`, one driving `gh`, env inheritance through the sandbox, and headless
isolation surviving a parallel `bash` + `read` batch. See
[`tests/README.md`](tests/README.md).

## Roadmap

Tracked in [issues](https://github.com/1aboveio/pi-better-subagents/issues).
Near-term:

- Guarantee subagent autonomy — verify/deny any child→parent supervision
  back-channel so a child can never block on the parent ([#1](https://github.com/1aboveio/pi-better-subagents/issues/1)).
- Make `callback:true` a lightweight trigger instead of embedding the full result
  twice ([#2](https://github.com/1aboveio/pi-better-subagents/issues/2)) — **done**.
- Named agent-definition files (per-agent system prompt + tool allowlist) and
  chain/parallel orchestration.
